        <p class="about-text">
            The third movement of this act marks the end of a start. We are so attached with the outer virtual and the physical endeavors that block us what we truly are. The real challenge lies in learning to detach from these distractions to discover who we truly are. That's what I wanted to express. There's this intrusion of these outer ideas, thoughts that disturb our mind. These days you see a lot more people dressed the same way, acting the same way, listening the same thing. Maybe I am hating but as I said before, one thing I see through my eyes is that there is less unicity nowadays. This blind-self-reliance on external validation and conformity has created a culture of uniformity. We are trapped in the illusion that by blending in, we are somehow securing our identity. But in reality, we are losing the essence of who we are. The constant need to align with societal trends, opinions, and expectations blinds us to our own unique thoughts and desires. We no longer rely on our inner voice, but rather on the echo of the masses. The tragedy here is that self-reliance, in its purest form, should lead us toward independence and self-discovery. Instead, we have distorted it into a reliance on the external mirror of what others expect us to be. This misguided pursuit of belonging erases our individuality. We become mere reflections of the collective, rather than the distinct individuals we were meant to be.

            Perhaps, to regain our unity, we must challenge this blind-self-reliance. We need to cultivate the courage to stand apart, to embrace solitude, and to listen to the whispers of our own minds. Only then can we break free from the chains of conformity and rediscover the authenticity that has been buried beneath layers of societal expectations. In a world where sameness is celebrated, the real act of rebellion is in embracing our differences. The journey toward true self-reliance requires us to question the influences that shape us, to detach from the noise, and to trust in our ability to navigate life based on our own instincts and values. Only then can we truly know what it means to rely on ourselves.
